# Rock Paper Scissors project
This project was made possible thanks to [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

First part was just playing through the JavaScript console, next part was adding some UI and using DOM manipulation. 
I tried not to spend too much time to make it pretty, since I read [here](https://dev.to/theodinproject/learning-code-f56) that I should focus
on the point of assignment and to not spend too much time styling the project. 

But maybe I'll come back to it someday.
